Note: If you opt not to provide Personal Information on the Platform, we may be unable to offer you certain, if not all, Platform services.

In any situation, we will not be accountable or responsible if we are unable to provide certain services to you due to the users’ failure to provide the required information.



PURPOSE

The primary reason that PoolPay requires user data is to provide our services and products, as well as platform access and customer service while adhering to standards through internal processes that ensure service quality and safety. The User Data will be used to (i) provide the services that we that offer and provide, (ii) information regarding any changes in the service itself or an aspect of it, (iii) evaluate the quality of service provided, and (iv) send technical and/or commercial information about our services, (v) send updated information that the Company deems pertinent and that is related to the services PoolPay provides, (vi) in general, to assess the user activity patterns and trends, and (vii) to maintain effective contact with our user database.

User Data may include private and confidential information about users that they provide to PoolPay through any voluntary means or to third parties for PoolPay to carry out the necessary tasks for the provision of the services in question; and in such cases, PoolPay will maintain the privacy and/or confidentiality of such information, as appropriate, using the same protection measures that the Company uses to maintain the confidentiality of its data.

The secondary purposes for which we collect user data are: billing, collection, informing customers about new products, services, or changes in them, promotional messages; evaluating the quality of the service; complying with the obligations derived from the provision of the service; complying with current applicable legislation; responding to requests for information from any authority, whether for investigations, statistics, or regulatory reports; attending to user comments related to the provision of services; send notices and information about our services; and contribute to the process of continuous improvement.

Consequently, PoolPay shall be responsible for collecting, using, and protecting users' data, with the notion that all acquired user data must be processed by PoolPay by the principles of legality, consent, information, quality, purpose, loyalty, proportionality, and responsibility according to the applicable Law and Regulations. The voluntary contribution or transfer of personal data to PoolPay by any individual through any means implies that the said individual accepts and expressly authorizes the Company's management of the user data so acquired.

We may also use users’ email, phone, location, and expense ledgers authorized by relevant legislation, to display relevant advertising or promotions on our site that we feel may be of interest to the user. 



DATA SHARING

PoolPay will NOT SHARE any user data with any Third Party except as stated herein in this privacy statement or without user consent or as under:

•	PoolPay was designed to keep track of, distribute, and pay off costs in a shared ledger known as a Pool. We share some of the users’ personal information with other PoolPay members, such as their names, email addresses, phone number, and user profile picture. Users who have an email address and/or phone number can add other users as a friend and view the users’ names, email addresses, and user profile pictures. Unless a user includes another user in those expenditures or puts them in a group, they won't be able to see the expenditures added with other friends. The onus and caution of who users form a Pool rest solely in the hands of the users and therefore they must filter and select what users they add into their Pool as personal information will be accessible amongst all users that are party to the Pool.

•	To aid and improve our services, we may appoint third-party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or service providers. Third parties that have access to user personal information on our behalf are contractually obligated to follow our privacy policy and are not permitted to use it for any other reason. 

•	PoolPay reserves the discretionary right to share and disclose user data with law enforcement, governmental authorities, and any other third party to respond to legal processes, court subpoenas, or court directions and in situations of emergency to protect an individual’s safety.

•	In the event of a change of structure of our management due to a merger, acquisition, a business transfer, we may transfer or sell user data to third parties, including but not limited to the personal information and any other information the user may give out to the company.  The responsibility for the user data will be transferred to such a third party and they shall have the rights and duties stated in this Privacy Policy and accordance with relevant legislation.

•	We may disclose non-identifiable information that does not individually identify a user by personal credentials and this includes under its ambit, information shared with third parties for research, marketing, analytics, and/or promotional purposes, as well as to assist us in determining how we might optimize our service further.

•	PoolPay allows access to third-party API services which allows other social media and email apps to gain access to the data users provide to PoolPay. However, this is completely voluntary and data will not be shared with these API integrated apps unless users authorize login with third-party apps. We do not hold any degree of control over these third-party API integrated apps and make no warranties about their safety or the non-fraudulent nature of the operation. By agreeing to our policy, the user agrees that PoolPay is not responsible or liable for any breach of user privacy by these third-party services and agrees to indemnify PoolPay in the event of an incident.

PoolPay allows API integration solely for the convenience of the user as API integration allows seamless communication between various applications and enables users to get the benefits of multiple cloud-based applications.

If not protested to sharing of user data for the purposes stated above, it will be assumed that consent has been provided. All contracts with third parties that involve the processing of user personal information in the name and on behalf of PoolPay will include a clause ensuring that they provide the same level of personal data protection as PoolPay, as aforementioned in the above clauses. 



DATA PROTECTION

PoolPay puts the utmost importance on the privacy of user data. There are various technical systems in place which include but are not limited to data encryption and authentication procedures to maintain the privacy of user data. However, despite the company’s effort to protect user data, the users also must be vigilant and prevent unauthorized use of personal data. Such a breach of data caused by negligence on the users’ behalf will be solely their responsibility and cost to bear. 

We will notify users via email or a prominent posting on our Site in the event there is a breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of users’ unencrypted electronically stored personal information, in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, as long as it is consistent with
i)	the legitimate needs of law enforcement and/or 
ii)	any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

Although we make good faith attempts to keep information in a secure operating environment that is not exposed to the public, users should be aware that no security system is perfect, and we cannot guarantee that user information will not be disclosed in an unanticipated manner. If we become aware that user information has been disclosed in a way that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will make reasonable efforts to notify users of the nature and extent of the disclosure, to the extent that we are aware of it, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.

•	COOKIES
Cookies are used by us and by using the PoolPay website and app, users agree to the use of cookies by PoolPay's privacy policy. Most modern interactive websites and apps use cookies to allow us to retrieve user information for each visit. Cookies are used in some areas of our site to enable functionality and ease of use for visitors. Some of our affiliate/advertising partners may also use cookies.
Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but users can usually modify the user browser’s setting to decline cookies if preferred so. If a user chooses to decline cookies, certain features of our Services, including the Service itself may not function properly or remain accessible.

•	PHISHING
Online Identity Theft is a very pertinent issue in the status quo of the internet age. Users must be wary and ensure stringent passwords that cannot be easily hacked. PoolPay recommends users change their passwords now and again and avoid using repetitive passwords. 

•	DATA RETENTION
In compliance with relevant and applicable provisions of law, we shall retain personal information to provide service to the user and to maintain the user account for as long as the user account is active. Another reason the company retains personal information is to prevent fraudulent activities, resolve disputes, enforce our Terms of Service, and/or comply with applicable law.
Following the termination of a PoolPay account, we are obligated by law to keep certain records for a set amount of time, which will contain user data such as user name, contact information, customer number, and transaction history, among other things. When the user (or we) close the PoolPay account, we shall erase and destroy any Personal Information we have. We do not save user payment information under any circumstances.

•	CHILD POLICY
We, at PoolPay, have a strict policy about the use of our service by children under 14 years of age. PoolPay is not designed for usage by minors or children under the age of fourteen. We do not collect personally identifying information from children under the age of thirteen. If a parent or guardian learns that their kid has given us Personal Information without their permission, they should notify us at @. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has supplied us with Personal Information, we will promptly remove the information from our records.

•	UPDATE POLICY
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes take effect soon after they are posted. A disclaimer on the date of the update will specify a modification or update.
