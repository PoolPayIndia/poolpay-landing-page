Welcome to PoolPay! PoolPay is an electronic ledger system that lets you split bills with other users by creating a shared ledger known as a Pool. Currently, a beta version is in place which offers a singular feature which is QucikSplit, wherein a user can generate a single link for all the parties to a given Pool, which details each user’s individual share. In the coming months, the roll out all features will take place which will include but not be limited to pertinent features such as advanced pooling and pay-out which allows users to make an anticipatory shared ledger, or a Pool, split and pay the said Pool well in advance. 

The PoolPay "Terms of Use" is an electronic record as defined by the Information Technology Act of 2000, and are created by a computer system without the use of physical or digital signatures. This document is produced in compliance with Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, which mandates that the Platform undertake due diligence.

Before accessing, downloading, or using the 'PoolPay' Platform, please read the Terms and Conditions carefully. By using PoolPay's services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions.

Users shall agree to all the clauses stated in this document (including the Privacy Policy) when they agree to the Terms of Use and this shall be binding on users once agreed to (under the laws of the Republic of India). If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be assumed to be supplanted by a legally enforceable provision that closely reflects the original agreement's meaning, and all other sections of the agreement shall be enforced. Users also affirm that the failure on behalf of PoolPay to exercise or enforce any part of this agreement and terms does not constitute a waiver of the rights or provisions of this agreement.
